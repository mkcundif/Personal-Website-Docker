        <p>I am a graduate of Indiana University, where I earned a double major in Finance and Accounting, and I am currently pursuing a Master's in Information Systems at the Kelley School of Business. My academic and professional interests center around the intersection of technology and accounting, with a focus on how IT systems can enhance financial integrity, compliance, and organizational transparency.</p>

        <p>I am passionate about bridging the gap between accounting principles and information technology and leveraging tools like data analytics, automation, and emerging technologies to improve decision-making and risk management. My current focus lies in IT audit, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence, where I aim to understand how technology can safeguard financial data, streamline processes, and ensure that businesses operate securely and efficiently.</p>

        <p>Through my education and projects, I've developed a strong appreciation for how technology not only supports accounting but also transforms it, from internal controls and audit processes to enterprise systems and data governance. My goal is to build a career that connects financial insight with technology-driven solutions, helping organizations strengthen compliance, enhance efficiency, and drive sustainable success.</p>

        <p>Outside of academics and professional pursuits, I'm an avid sports enthusiast. I enjoy playing golf, soccer, and basketball, and I love snowboarding during the winter months. Sports have taught me the value of focus, teamwork, and persistence, qualities that I bring to everything I do.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, I aspire to become a professional who stands at the crossroads of finance, technology, and security, helping businesses navigate digital transformation while maintaining trust, accuracy, and resilience.</p>
